## Network vulnerabilities and attacks
---

1. **SWEET32**:
   A vulnerability related to 3DES encryption in SSL/TLS protocols, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt sensitive data by exploiting the small block size of 3DES.
---
2. **BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS)**:
   A vulnerability that targets the SSL/TLS encryption used in web browsers, enabling attackers to decrypt parts of SSL-encrypted traffic.
---
3. **Birthday Attack**:
   A cryptographic attack that leverages the birthday paradox to find collisions in hash functions more efficiently than brute force.
---
4. **Rainbow Table Attack**:
   An attack that uses precomputed tables to crack password hashes quickly, bypassing password security by finding corresponding plaintext passwords.
---
5. **CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy)**:
   A vulnerability that targets SSL/TLS compression, enabling attackers to recover sensitive information like cookies and session tokens.
---
6. **POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption)**:
   An attack exploiting the SSLv3 protocol's vulnerability, allowing attackers to decrypt SSL/TLS connections and gain access to sensitive information.
---
7. **DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption)**:
   A cross-protocol attack that can decrypt TLS connections by exploiting the use of obsolete encryption methods in SSLv2.
---
8. **FREAK (Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys)**:
   An attack that targets SSL/TLS connections, allowing attackers to force the use of weak encryption and potentially decrypt intercepted data.
---
9. **BLEEDINGBIT**:
   A set of vulnerabilities in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chips that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain control over affected devices.
---
10. **Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169)**:
    A vulnerability in the Unix Bash shell, allowing remote code execution by manipulating environment variables to execute arbitrary commands.
---
11. **EternalBlue (MS17-010)**:
    A vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, exploited by malware like WannaCry to spread.
---
12. **ZombieLoad (Microarchitectural Data Sampling - MDS)**:
    A class of speculative execution vulnerabilities affecting Intel CPUs that can leak data from various memory locations.
---
13. **Logjam (CVE-2015-4000)**:
    This attack targets the Diffie-Hellman key exchange used in TLS, allowing attackers to downgrade encryption and potentially decrypt intercepted data.
---
14. **BlueBorne**:
    An attack vector that exploits Bluetooth connections, allowing attackers to take control of devices, spread malware, and execute arbitrary code.
---
15. **Rowhammer**:
    A vulnerability that targets the physical hardware, specifically memory cells, to manipulate adjacent bits, potentially leading to privilege escalation attacks.
